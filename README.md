## Debugging content of a form

Rendering of a form can be easily tested through sample react application provided in `./test` folder. The application can be  started by executing npm script through `npm run rendering-test-start` and then accessing `./test/rendering/index.html` from a browser. It renders the form provided by file `./test/rendering/form.json`. See `./test/rendering/TestApp.js` for more details.
